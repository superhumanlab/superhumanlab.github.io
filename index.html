		<p>The Superhuman Computing Lab is a research group in the <a href="http://cs.colorado.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://colorado.edu">University of Colorado Boulder</a>, devoted to research on accessible, mobile, and wearable technologies. It is directed by <a href="http://shaunkane.info">Shaun Kane.</a></p>
		<h2>Research Areas</h2>
		<p>Our research focuses on projects that enhance people's physical, sensory, and creative abilities. Our current research addresses the following problem areas:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Accessibility.</strong> How can we make current and future technologies more accessible to people with disabilities and other underrepresented groups? How can we leverage emerging computing technologies to enhance individuals' current abilities?</li>
			<li><strong>Mobile and wearable computing.</strong> How can we design mobile and wearable computing to support users on the go, especially when working in distracting environments?</li>
			<li><strong>Creative tools and everyday making.</strong> How can we make new personal fabrication devices such as 3D printers more accessible to novice users, hobbyists, and people with disabilites?</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Projects and Publications</h2>
		<p>See <a href="http://shaunkane.info/projects.html">current projects</a> and <a href="http://shaunkane.info/pubs.html">recent publications.</a></p>
		<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>
		<p>We are actively recruiting undergraduate and graduate students in multiple research areas (computer science, human-centered computing, design, and others) to participate in ongoing and future research projects. For more information about research opportunities, contact <a href="http://shaunkane.info">Shaun Kane</a>.</p>
